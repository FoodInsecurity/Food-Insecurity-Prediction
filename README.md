## Food-Insecurity-Prediction
Predicting acute food insecurity and humanitarian crises using machine learning models trained on IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) data

# Project Overview
This project develops machine learning models to predict IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) severity levels (1â€“5) using multi-dimensional data including socio-economic indicators, conflict data, agricultural metrics, and climate factors.

# Target Variable

ipc_phase: Severity classification (1-5)

1: Minimal food insecurity
2: Stressed
3: Crisis (acute food insecurity)
4: Emergency (humanitarian emergency)
5: Famine (humanitarian catastrophe)


# Key Identifiers

iso3: Country ISO3 code
country: Country name
year: Assessment year
phase_type: Assessment type/period
